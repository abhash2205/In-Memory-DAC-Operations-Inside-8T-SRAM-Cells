## Abstract
The von-Neumann computing methodology dominates most of the today's processor architecture. In such architecture, program and data are decoupled from each other leading to massive latency as well as energy consumption due to frequent shuttling back and forth of data between physically separate memory and computing cores also known as bottleneck. Digital to analog convertor (DAC) is one of the frequently used block inside any processing core which needs to interface analog and digital world. In this paper, we will design an 8T SRAM based in-memory DAC convertor to overcome the von-Neumann bottleneck.
